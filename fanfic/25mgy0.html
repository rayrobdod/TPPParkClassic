<h1>Steven-Senpai Part 1: An Emerald Story</h1>
<!-- by /u/Epicnights on request -->

<p>A wandered through the cave, a grim look on her face. Before she had left for Dewford Town, she was tasked by Mr. Stone, the CEO of Devon Corporation, to deliver a letter to his son Steven Stone. She’d never heard of the guy before, and she had absolutely no clue what he, or anyone for that matter, would be doing in the darkness of Granite Cave.</p>

<p>“This family must be full of crazy people,” A muttered to herself as she entered another chamber of the cave. “Hiding in a cave like this...I swear, if I don’t get anything out of this little ‘errand’ I’m running, I will­” She stopped mid­sentence.</p>

<p>Just ahead of her was a strapping young man dressed in what appeared to be a black suit, kneeling and examining the cavern wall. His hair was a shining silver, and he had silver rings on his upper arms. A could only guess that it was Steven.</p>

<p>“Hey, are you Steven?” Steven looked up from the wall, then turned and stood up to face A.</p>

<p>He looked even more impressive from the front, with a royal purple design on his suit jacket and a silky red ascot. The voices turned into a buzz, making various catcalls and compliments about Steven. Even A found herself staring for a little bit.</p>

<p>“Why yes, I am Steven. Steven Stone. And you are...?” A snapped out of her little stupor.</p>

<p>“Oh, umm, I’m A. Err...” She fumbled for the letter in her bag.“Here. A Mr., umm... Mr. Stone, yeah. A Mr. Stone from Devon wanted me to deliver this to you.” She handed over the letter, which Steven promptly opened.</p>

<p>“Hmm...” He read through the letter. “Well, I’ll have to remember to see my father, then.” He folded up the letter and stowed it into his pocket. "Thank you so much for bringing me this letter. It must have been quite a trek for you to get here...” He snapped his fingers, as if an idea had struck him. “I know! Here, let me give you something for your efforts.”</p>

<p>A shook her head. “Oh, no, you don’t have to-­”</p>

<p>“Oh but I do. For a girl like you to brave the darker depths of this cavern is a means for praise.” He pulled out a TM from his pocket. “Here, for you. It’s Steel Wing.” A took the TM, a surprised look on her face. “I’m a Steel type specialist, actually. There’s something about them that I just find amazing.” He brushed off the dust from his pants. “Anyway, I must be on my way. Thank you so much, A.” He picked up his things and headed out of the chamber, leaving A still staring at the disk, a bit of a blush tinting her cheeks.</p>
