<h1>May I Stay?</h1>
<p>Twitch Plays Pokemon Red</p>
<p>Original Lyrics by /u/AgainTheSaga</p>
<p>Music is <a href="www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQURrpte4mI">"Fingerstyle Guitar Cover" of Hallelujah by Patrick Matlock</a></p> 
<p>Song "Hallelujah" is by John Cale</p>

<p>TwitchPlaysPokemon found me in a time in my life when I was really struggling. Because of the experience, the community, the stories, and the nostalgia, I was able to find myself in ways I hadn't been able to before. The song "Hallelujah" is almost sacred to me, as I find it one of (if not THEE) most beautiful song ever written, so I chose to write lyrics expressing my own experience with the stream to it, since TwitchPlaysPokemon has now earned an incredibly special place in my heart.</p>

<lyrics>
<p>		In Winter air I searched this realm
<p>		For something that could overwhelm
<p>		This struggling heart of mine aching for purpose
<p>		I knew not what had graced my eyes
<p>		My childhood did recognize
<p>		The friends I'd long ago pushed aside
<p>		
<p>		Hello, Misty
<p>		Hello, Pidgey
<p>		Have you heard my plea?
<p>		Though years have changed me, may I stay?
<p>		
<p>		Thousands more with faceless names
<p>		Were gathered by this man arcane
<p>		Whose sole intent was mere curiosity
<p>		All formed a fellowship so strong
<p>		It proved the world's idea of unity wrong
<p>		Redefined the meaning, made it stronger
<p>		
<p>		Hello, Zapdos
<p>		Hello, Moon Stone
<p>		Am I too old?
<p>		Though years have changed me, may I stay?
<p>		
<p>		Then came the birth of art and lore
<p>		A community with open doors
<p>		For every soul who longed to share their world
<p>		Was this the sickness I had craved?
<p>		A new reason to approach the day
<p>		An accidental stumble that helped to save me
<p>		
<p>		Hello, Kanto
<p>		Your world I'll always hold
<p>		Time has made me cold
<p>		You helped me break that mold
<p>		My voice is but one
<p>		In a chorus of thousands
<p>		Together we have done
<p>		The impossible and won
<p>		
<p>		Outside I drown in the sins that I must atone for
<p>		Here I suffer not from thoughts that I am alone
<p>		May I stay?
<p>		
<p>		Hello, my youth
<p>		Please walk with me
<p>		Follow closely
<p>		For there is much to see
