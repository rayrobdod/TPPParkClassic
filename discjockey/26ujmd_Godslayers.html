<p>Godslayers is a pulse-pounding electronic and orchestral crossover song of battle, with lyrics inspired from Twitch Plays Pokémon.</p>

<p>Lazor Gator has made it to Mt. Silver and the final battle against the Gods begins! With a team led by AJ, consisting of Lazor Gator, Burrito, Solid Snake, Brian, Katie, and a Raticate, the Godslayers will prove to the Chosen Six that there are no gods, no kings, ONLY MON!!</p>

<p>(But is it really the end of Helix? Nay! For the Helix sacrificed himself, so that a world of "Only Mon", that he originally envisioned, could come to be. So do not fret, for His holy spiral of love continues to guide us forever. Praise be to the Helix!)</p>

<lyrics>
<p>		They go unto the mountain
<p>		To face the Kanto Champions
<p>		Red awaits
<p>		To meet AJ
<p>		Will the Helix rise or fall
<p>		
<p>		Here come the Godslayers
<p>		The Helix will not win
<p>		At the mountain-top where war begins
<p>		KT will slay the dragon slayer
<p>		Brian will fly without your prayers
<p>		Woah woah woah
<p>		The Godslayers
<p>		
<p>		The Hydro Pump was pouring
<p>		And surf’s waves were roaring
<p>		And the lasers burn
<p>		On the Gator’s turn
<p>		The end of Helix, come
<p>		
<p>		See the Chosen Six
<p>		Upholding anarchy
<p>		Seated at the throne of Helix
<p>		ATV still has Poison Powder
<p>		Gods and Kings in their finest hour
<p>		Woah Woah Woah
<p>		
<p>		The Godslayers
<p>		Split the Spiral Shell there
<p>		And Mt. Silver burned
<p>		In their vengeance
<p>		For the Admiral, and Togepi
<p>		The Helix wept
<p>		There is sacrifice in Anarchy
<p>		
<p>		Now see the Helix rise
<p>		Prove your Mon’s cause wise
<p>		
<p>		Before these Gods and Kings will go
<p>		The fury of the Helix will unfold
<p>		In Thunder, wave, and tentacle
<p>		
<p>		Praise the Helix
<p>		Rise and Fall Helix
<p>		"Now is not the time to use that"
<p>		
<p>		No Gods
<p>		No Kings
<p>		Only Mon
<p>		
<p>		(Woah woah woah)
<p>		Here comes the Godslayers
<p>		Remember the Chosen Six
<p>		The sacrifice of Helix
<p>		At the feet of the Godslayers
