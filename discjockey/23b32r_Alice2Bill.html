<h1>Daughter to Father/Alice to Bill</h1>
<p>Twitch Plays Pokemon FireRed</p>

<p>Song is an instrumental version of "Confessions of a Broken Heart" by Lindsay Lohan</p>
<p>Original lyrics and sung by /u/AgainTheSaga</p>

<p>This is Alice's thoughts towards her father Bill once she discovers how he has destroyed Kanto (by randomizing it) and her inner conflict between doing what's right by defeating him in order to save it and obeying his wishes as his daughter.</p>

<lyrics>
<p>		I wait for the voices
<p>		to give me an answer
<p>		and I wait for the Helix
<p>		to make things get better
<p>		and as I carry Kanto's bleak future on my shoulders
<p>		anarchy is dying, and this world just grows colder
<p>		
<p>		all this time did you know?
<p>		oh father did you know?
<p>		just tell me did you know
<p>		
<p>		daughter to father
<p>		daughter to father
<p>		Kanto is broken and everyone's hoping
<p>		for a true hero
<p>		to rescue tomorrow
<p>		they say it's your cause, and it's here will I pause
<p>		because how could, I bring, destruction
<p>		to my own father's world
<p>		
<p>		the dome speaks to me softly
<p>		tells me of an order
<p>		I could bring to this wonderland
<p>		I could be the martyr
<p>		
<p>		(but to) fight for the lives
<p>		of the people you've shunned
<p>		forces conflict inside
<p>		but I really just can't run
<p>		
<p>		no I can't run away
<p>		please don't ask me to stay
<p>		your reign will end today
<p>		
<p>		daughter to father
<p>		daughter to father
<p>		I don't want to
<p>		disobey you
<p>		order's imminent
<p>		you've shamed the innocent
<p>		tell me the truth, did you release them all?
<p>		no, how could, I be, the daughter, of such a ruthless man?
<p>		such a ruthless man?
<p>		
<p>		I still love you
<p>		I still love you
<p>		I still love you
<p>		but I.....
<p>		I will defeat you
<p>		
<p>		daughter to father
<p>		daughter to father
<p>		I never knew you
<p>		but I am not like you
<p>		I am the chosen
<p>		a daughter so broken
<p>		tell me the truth, will you still love me?
<p>		after all, will you love me?
<p>		I am....
<p>		the destruction, of my father's world
<p>		
<p>		I wait for the voices
<p>		to give me an answer....
