<h1>Praise The Helix REMIX</h1>
<p>This remix of Praise The Helix was made with the help of fan submissions!</p>

<p>In the spirit of the crowd-sourced "Twitch Plays Pokémon", in April 2014, Church Of The Helix Choir opened it's doors for anyone to sing or play along with their song "Praise The Helix" for a brand new idea: a crowd-sourced remix. What resulted were a handful of submissions that have now been put together by COTHC into this new re-working of the original, which I am very proud to present!</p>

<p>Thank you for being a part of the Choir, and as appreciation for the support you've given, this song is "pay if you want". Download it for free... or leave a donation if you like.</p>

<p>Give a major kudos to the awesome folks who put themselves out there to be a part of this! I hope we can do this again in the future-and make it bigger next time!</p>

<p>If you want to give your support, it goes towards more Church Of The Helix Choir songs and more music from me (Mark) so I can keep doing this in the future! Thank you so much for being a part of the Choir and all the support you've given thus far.</p>

<p>Helix Bless You! Praise the Helix!!!</p>

<lyrics>
<p>		Praise Thee Oh Blessed Helix
<p>		Who Doth Guide Me Past The Ledge
<p>		And Giveth Holy Bird To Guide Us
<p>		With Gust and Sand-Attack
<p>		
<p>		Helix We Consult Thee
<p>		Set Straight Our Frantic Path
<p>		
<p>		Oak May Say It's Not The Time For That
<p>		But You Keep Us From Dome's Wrath
<p>		
<p>		Helix Thou My Riches
<p>		I Will Toss My Nugget For Thee
<p>		
<p>		When Those Who Press Start Try My Path
<p>		Thou Raise Thy Saints Of B
<p>		
<p>		Rest Blessed Abby
<p>		Rest Jay Leno
<p>		You Were Not Released In Vain
<p>		Forever Helix Keep Them
<p>		
<p>		As We Surf Forwards
<p>		And Cut Every Tree
<p>		The Helix Ever Will Be My Strength
<p>		As I Fly To Anarchy...
<p>		
<p>		Praise Thee Oh Blessed Helix
<p>		Who Doth Guide Me Past The Ledge
<p>		And Giveth Holy Bird To Guide Us
<p>		With Gust and Sand-Attack
<p>		
<p>		Helix, Helix (We consult thee),
<p>		Set straight our frantic path
<p>		
<p>		Rest Blessed Abby
<p>		(Oak may say it's not the time for that)
<p>		Rest Jay Leno
<p>		(But you keep us from Dome's wrath)
<p>		You Were Not Released In Vain
<p>		Forever Helix Keep Them
<p>		
<p>		As We Surf Forwards
<p>		And Cut Every Tree
<p>		The Helix Ever Will Be My Strength
<p>		As I Fly To Anarchy...
