<lyrics>
<p>		It's not easy when your trainer thinks she's three
<p>		Camila, Slash, and "A" for Anarchy
<p>		Can't evolve, and they want me released
<p>		So I'll take all of their EXP
<p>		
<p>		And then she started trying to change
<p>		The trainer showed some other ways
<p>		But I still can't trust her yet
<p>		She's playin' with fire, playing with fire again
<p>		
<p>		I'm Bringing Zexy Back
<p>		Cause that girl don't know how to act
<p>		Peer into the hollow of my back
<p>		We'll "Bulk Up" when your soul has passed
<p>		
<p>		I'll fly around the world
<p>		Just to find another girl
<p>		Loneliness doesn't have to last
<p>		We'll evolve in another land
<p>		
<p>		It's quiet here, in this space
<p>		Where Pok√©mon are released
<p>		But this girl named Abby gets my past
<p>		And I needed some time to learn who I am
<p>		And my fire burns for that first girl
<p>		And I got another chance to light up her world
<p>		To help that girl as much as I can
<p>		I fly in like a ninja, armor-clad
<p>		
<p>		(Zexinja, A Bug Ninja)
<p>		
<p>		I'm Bringing Zexy Back
<p>		Cause that girl don't know how to act
<p>		Peer into the hollow of my back
<p>		We'll "Bulk Up" when your soul has passed
<p>		
<p>		I'll fly around the world
<p>		Just to find another girl
<p>		Loneliness doesn't have to last
<p>		We'll evolve in another land
<p>		
<p>		Did you ever, did you ever miss me?
<p>		Did you ever, did you ever know how much I cared?
<p>		I've got another chance to make sure you get by
<p>		If it can't be me I'll train another to take my place by your side
<p>		
<p>		I'm Bringing Zexy Back
<p>		Cause that girl don't know how to act
<p>		Peer into the hollow of my back
<p>		We'll "Bulk Up" when your soul has passed
<p>		
<p>		I'll fly around the world
<p>		Just to find another girl
<p>		Loneliness doesn't have to last
<p>		We'll evolve in another land
<p>		
<p>		I'm Bringing Zexy Back
<p>		Chillin' with Abby in a far off land
<p>		This Flareon doesn't seem so bad
<p>		Jay Leno, yeah, he's the man
<p>		(She's gonna be okay, she's got M4, anyway)
