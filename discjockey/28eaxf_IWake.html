<lyrics>
<p>		I'm dreaming I'm alone
<p>		Please do not awake, me
<p>		Sunlight used to feel like home
<p>		Now it's charring me
<p>		
<p>		I am safe here in my dreams
<p>		Where you're not allowed
<p>		Cold is comfort in the dark
<p>		I hear not a single sound
<p>		
<p>		Let me sleep away this nightmare
<p>		Your gaze had burned until my soul was bare
<p>		I choose to stay within my holy realm
<p>		Where wishes are pure and life is fair
<p>		
<p>		I am lost
<p>		I wake to seek out where your love has gone
<p>		Why can't I
<p>		Sacrifice my everything for a try
<p>		Despite my fear of pain
<p>		Within me nothing's changed
<p>		My heart still beats against the warmth of your flame
<p>		
<p>		Separate your soul from mine
<p>		Taint her with your words
<p>		For I have grown to hate the taste
<p>		Of all the ones I've heard
<p>		
<p>		The night is cold but it's okay
<p>		It wraps me in its arms
<p>		Cradles me while I dream
<p>		Keeps me safe from harm
<p>		
<p>		Your eyes tell tales of another life
<p>		I sleep to venture there and free myself of strife
<p>		Inside, your love washes over me
<p>		And your name for me is... "wife"
<p>		
<p>		I am lost
<p>		I wake to seek out where your love has gone
<p>		Do you see
<p>		I've fallen down searching for reasons to be
<p>		Despite the pain you gave
<p>		Within me nothing's changed
<p>		My heart still beats against the warmth of your flame
<p>		
<p>		Though I may beg
<p>		That world is only in my head
<p>		
<p>		I am lost
<p>		I wake to seek out where your love has gone
<p>		I am alone
<p>		It was your love that made me feel at home
<p>		Despite the tears I cry
<p>		I feed myself this lie:
<p>		One day we'll find a way to reunite
<p>		Help me live my dream
<p>		I'll wake when it all seems
<p>		Like you and I again can become a team
