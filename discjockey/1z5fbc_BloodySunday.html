<lyrics>
<p>		To the Power Plant
<p>		On the Eleventh Day
<p>		Pokemaniacs,
<p>		They could not block our way
<p>		
<p>		Bring the Master Ball
<p>		We will claim our sacred prize
<p>		We did celebrate when we left with Zapdos inside
<p>		
<p>		Then we ran to the PC to take the one named AA-J
<p>		And the tension was mounting as we mashed Down, B, and A
<p>		
<p>		Bloody Sunday
<p>		Now our team has room for more
<p>		Bloody Sunday
<p>		Dome's not won the war
<p>		From Bill's Boxes
<p>		On the Eleventh Day
<p>		Helix giveth
<p>		And the Helix took away
<p>		
<p>		Then Bird Jesus let a Mirror-Move reflect from up on high
<p>		We could see the lost ones congregate in joy with Omanyte
<p>		
<p>		No one shall fux with the Dux no more
<p>		xCabbage will forever spread Stun Spore
<p>		Digrat will Dig them to the light where we
<p>		Will meet the Helix together
<p>		
<p>		To the Power Plant...
<p>		To the Power Plant...
<p>		
<p>		Bloody Sunday
<p>		Now our team has room for more
<p>		Bloody Sunday
<p>		Dome's not won the war
<p>		From Bill's Boxes
<p>		On the Eleventh Day
<p>		Helix giveth
<p>		And the Helix took away
<p>		
<p>		No one shall fux with the Dux no more
<p>		xCabbage will forever spread Stun Spore
<p>		Digrat will Dig them to the light where we
<p>		Will meet the Helix together
