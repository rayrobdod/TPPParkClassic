<h1>I Dreamed a Run (TPPer's Lament)</h1>
<p>Twitch Plays Pokemon Black</p>
<p>Sung by /u/AgainTheSaga, Lyrics by /u/Tustin2121</p>
<p>Music is <a href="www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uhspvYoH6w">instrumental version of "I Dreamed A Dream"</a> from the musical Les Miserables</p>
<p>Tip: Change the pronouns in that middle segment, and this easily could apply to any run (except Red) where we released our starter. A little tweaking and perhaps it could apply to HeartGold too.</p>

<lyrics>
<p>		There was a time, the stream was kind
<p>		When the voices were soft, and the lore inviting....
<p>		There was a time when love was blind
<p>		And the 'mon praised a god, and the praise was exciting...
<p>		There was a time....
<p>		
<p>		Then it all.... went........ wrong....
<p>		
<p>		I watched a stream in time gone by
<p>		When views were high and time worth wasting
<p>		I watched as Mon would grow and rise
<p>		The art and songs and lore worth making
<p>		
<p>		Then Mon were unafraid and sweet
<p>		And fights were quick and brash and fruitful
<p>		There was no Gym we could not beat!
<p>		The sun up high, our journey hopeful!
<p>		
<p>		But the trolls would come at night...
<p>		With their B's they halted progress....
<p>		As the evolutions stopped...
<p>		And they turned those hopes to shame....
<p>		
<p>		He stayed a day here by our side
<p>		We started out on our adventure
<p>		He took the best of best in stride!
<p>		But he was gone when morning came...
<p>		
<p>		Yet still I have the hope to dream
<p>		To see the stream succeed together
<p>		But there are dreams too big to dream
<p>		And hope fades fast, our interest fading
<p>		
<p>		I had a dream this run would be
<p>		So different from this hell I'm seeing
<p>		So different now from what it seems.....
<p>		Now we have killed... the dream.... I.... dreamed....
