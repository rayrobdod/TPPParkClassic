<h1>All Terrain Victory</h1>
<p>A final send-off and celebration of the heroes of Twitch Plays Pokemon Gen 1. Hear of the great victory of a level 36 Venomoth against a level 62 Dragonite. Sing of the Helix's "Chosen Six", as we say goodbye to that glorious team and remember our unforgettable journey together.</p>

<p>The Church of the Helix Choir brings you songs about our lord and saviour, the Helix Fossil, and the adventures of Twitch Plays Pok√©mon.</p>

<p>Please support the Church of The Helix Choir!<br/>
We worked extremely hard on this song, and if there's enough interest, our humble fellowship will continue to make songs that chronicle the events of TPP!<br/>
Thank you for your support!</p>

<lyrics>
<p>		To the Elite Four we will go
<p>		We will conquer Victr'y Road
<p>		On every boulder that needs strength
<p>		Anarchy will find a way
<p>		
<p>		A God
<p>		And an Angel
<p>		A Messiah
<p>		An All Terrain Vehicle
<p>		A King
<p>		And a Prince
<p>		The Chosen Six
<p>		Led by the Helix
<p>		
<p>		Lorelei, Bruno, Agatha, Indigo Plateau
<p>		Lance has come to meet us
<p>		Our warriors fought, but were defeated
<p>		
<p>		Then ATV began to fight
<p>		Against the fearsome Dragonite
<p>		Dragonskin is still terrain
<p>		Our hero lived up to his name
<p>		
<p>		And he disabled Hyper Beam
<p>		To save our fainted team
<p>		No attack would pierce his side
<p>		For the Helix was his guide
<p>		
<p>		He has slain the Dragon king!
<p>		Let the praises lift his wings!
<p>		Dragon-Slayer is his name,
<p>		Poison-Powder is his game.
<p>		
<p>		A God
<p>		And an Angel
<p>		A Messiah
<p>		An All Terrain Vehicle
<p>		A King
<p>		And a Prince
<p>		The Chosen Six
<p>		Led by the Helix
<p>		
<p>		The endgame begins
<p>		(As soon as we heal again)
<p>		No rival will be champion
<p>		
<p>		'Round the world we pressed "A" as one
<p>		
<p>		Thunder rocked the stage
<p>		From the wings of AAJ
<p>		Every player had a place
<p>		In the Kanto Hall of Fame
<p>		
<p>		From PC deep
<p>		The Keeper prayed
<p>		Rick Ghastly watched
<p>		From the Daycare's gates
<p>		All the friends we lost
<p>		In sixteen days
<p>		Were in our hearts
<p>		At the end of the game...
<p>		
<p>		A God
<p>		And an Angel
<p>		A Messiah
<p>		An All Terrain Vehicle
<p>		A King
<p>		And a Prince
<p>		The Chosen Six
<p>		Led by the Helix!
