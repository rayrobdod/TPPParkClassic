<lyrics>
<p>		one life held still
<p>		one battered man sought thrill
<p>		their fate: bastille
<p>		
<p>		voices cried out
<p>		a victim -- they couldn't live without
<p>		tis time for another bout
<p>		
<p>		let her rise
<p>		her sheltered demons will find
<p>		a way to enter her mind
<p>		with bloodshot eyes she will help redefine
<p>		Hoenn will soon know of the A-Team
<p>		message delivered in screams
<p>		they will bleed
<p>		the worst things in life happen all the time
<p>		here she'll find someone to take her hand
<p>		follow with footsteps on the sand
<p>		she will keep them alive to help them feign sublime
<p>		with her lead, demons feed on the suffering
<p>		will anyone give an offering?
<p>		it's so dark on this side
<p>		bring me towards the light
<p>		find me a light
<p>		
<p>		one bird, three dogs
<p>		blue face grins and walks along
<p>		future feels wrong
<p>		
<p>		up down, right left
<p>		fogged mind accepts
<p>		no longer deaf
<p>		
<p>		let her rise
<p>		befriended monsters inside
<p>		no longer need to hide
<p>		this isn't what the others had in mind
<p>		Hoenn will soon know of the A-team
<p>		while she is slowly drowning
<p>		in her dream
<p>		the worst things in life happen all the time
<p>		here she devotes all of her energy
<p>		into stifiling their plea
<p>		but tonight is different it seems
<p>		the voices pause in their tracks just to heed again
<p>		warnings left from other men
<p>		it's so dark on this side
<p>		bring me towards the light
<p>		
<p>		no angels will fly
<p>		while she is alive
<p>		Master Ball
<p>		can't catch what she has inside
<p>		this time, we reminisce of simpler fights
<p>		please obey and don't cry
<p>		
<p>		let her rise
<p>		can't fight the savage implied
<p>		control is what she will vie
<p>		no stopping now, can't turn back, won't keep track
<p>		of those who simply wanted her life
<p>		free of all of this strife
<p>		it's not right
<p>		the worst things in life shouldn't overtake
<p>		someone so pure and innocent
<p>		but she never really had a chance
<p>		the demands of the voices cried out
<p>		and in a day she became someone not devout
<p>		to the laws all the others shout
<p>		it's so dark on this side
<p>		I don't see the light...
<p>		
<p>		Don't see a light...
<p>		
<p>		A light, light
<p>		
<p>		Don't see a light, a light, a light
<p>		
<p>		Let her rise
