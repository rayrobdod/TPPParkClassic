<lyrics>
<p>		Hello my friends I see that you are hurting
<p>		The future you had hoped for is now burning
<p>		Trainers you fought for with pride have left you screaming
<p>		For an answer as to why, what was their meaning?
<p>		
<p>		Come, let me warm you
<p>		I'm sorry I can't undo
<p>		All the pain, the loss, betrayal that you feel
<p>		
<p>		Your fire is growing
<p>		Desire is building
<p>		For a world without the need for help to heal
<p>		You're no longer alone
<p>		I'm Abby, welcome home
<p>		
<p>		I'm Abby, welcome home
<p>		
<p>		All the battles, PC shuffling now is over
<p>		If you like you can decide to now grow older
<p>		We are all together now without an owner
<p>		It's alright, no pokeballs, no enclosure
<p>		
<p>		You've fought with such courage
<p>		Completed your purpose
<p>		Evolutions, cries, attacks were just the start
<p>		
<p>		Here you have no burdens
<p>		This freedom is certain
<p>		Your trainers are thankful for the strength within your hearts
<p>		You're no longer alone
<p>		I'm Abby, welcome home
<p>		
<p>		Every smile in your trainer's eyes
<p>		Even after you had to say goodbye
<p>		Was thanks to all the love that you supplied
<p>		So keep your head held high
<p>		
<p>		Keep your head held high
<p>		
<p>		Come, let me warm you
<p>		I'll help you make it through
<p>		All the pain, the loss, the sadness that you feel
<p>		You're no longer alone
<p>		I'm Abby, welcome home
<p>		
<p>		I'm Abby, welcome home
<p>		
<p>		With every step you paved another road
<p>		Every battle was a hope that you bestowed
<p>		To every friend you met you were a goad
<p>		Now here you are, welcome home
