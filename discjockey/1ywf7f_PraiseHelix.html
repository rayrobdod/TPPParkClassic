<lyrics>
<p>		Praise Thee Oh Blessed Helix
<p>		Who Doth Guide Me Past The Ledge
<p>		And Giveth Holy Bird To Guide Us
<p>		With Gust and Sand-Attack
<p>		
<p>		Helix We Consult Thee
<p>		Set Straight Our Frantic Path
<p>		
<p>		Oak May Say It's Not The Time For That
<p>		But You Keep Us From Dome's Wrath
<p>		
<p>		Helix Thou My Riches
<p>		I Will Toss My Nugget For Thee
<p>		
<p>		When Those Who Press Start Try My Path
<p>		Thou Raise Thy Saints Of B
<p>		
<p>		Rest Blessed Abby
<p>		Rest Jay Leno
<p>		You Were Not Released In Vain
<p>		Forever Helix Keep Them
<p>		
<p>		As We Surf Forwards
<p>		And Cut Every Tree
<p>		The Helix Ever Will Be My Strength
<p>		As I Fly To Anarchy...
