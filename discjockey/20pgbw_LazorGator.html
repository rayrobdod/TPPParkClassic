<p>With hints of Pok√©mon's "Azalea Town", this 80s-inspired tune is the tale of Lazor Gator, a Totodile who lost his innocence and picked up the sword of his beloved mentor, a Sentret named the "Admiral", and began a quest to defeat the Helix and the Chosen Six upon Mt. Silver. Based on the events of the collaboratively controlled game "Twitch Plays Pokemon".</p>

<lyrics>
<p>		A Totodile so young and brave
<p>		He shot lasers from his eyes and made a Scary Face
<p>		The voices would guide his way
<p>		In the land of Johto, chosen by AJ
<p>		
<p>		There was an Admiral who taught him to aim
<p>		Then he was gone and nothing's the same
<p>		He picked up the sword,
<p>		and he solemnly swore his revenge
<p>		
<p>		See you later,
<p>		Lazor Gator...
<p>		In a while,
<p>		Totodile...
<p>		He goes to deliver
<p>		A message to Mt. Silver
<p>		The Helix knew it all along
<p>		"No gods, no kings, only 'Mon"
<p>		
<p>		Only 'Mon,
<p>		No gods, no kings, only 'Mon
<p>		
<p>		In the shadow of the age before
<p>		A Gator and Brian try to find who they are
<p>		No they're not the saviours you're looking for
<p>		The voices raised a cry, "Release the Gator!"
<p>		
<p>		In the struggle, Prince Omelette was slain
<p>		If this is anarchy, who can we blame?
<p>		He'll make amends for all of his friends
<p>		in the end...
<p>		
<p>		See you later,
<p>		Lazor Gator...
<p>		In a while,
<p>		Totodile...
<p>		He goes to deliver
<p>		A message to Mt. Silver
<p>		The Helix knew it all along
<p>		"No gods, no kings, only 'Mon"
<p>		
<p>		Only 'Mon,
<p>		No gods, no kings, only 'Mon
<p>		
<p>		(repeat)
