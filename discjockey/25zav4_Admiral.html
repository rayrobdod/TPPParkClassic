<p>This is Lazorgator's story beginning when he was young and ending at the final battle on Mt. Silver. It is about his journey and his change in personality and attitude towards the gods once his dear friend the Admiral is taken from him. The song is meant to show emotion beginning with sadness and ultimately culminating in a triumphant cry of success once defeating the gods and avenging his friend.</p>

<lyrics>
<p>		I lived in a world where pain was a nuisance for the fighters
<p>		I lived in a world where I didn't need to learn composure
<p>		Surrounded by friends there was not a need for me to age
<p>		And yet something stirred inside and I was forced to turn the page
<p>		
<p>		My friend, how could you go?
<p>		Leave me with a burden so cold
<p>		I can't define my soul
<p>		These children need someone brave to hold
<p>		
<p>		Admiral!
<p>		Fate shadowed you, shoved you into a light
<p>		Oh, Helix, why?
<p>		Protecting them means I must learn to fight...
<p>		
<p>		The smallest one, I am afraid
<p>		Won't follow my lead
<p>		Tiny prince, you're just a babe
<p>		Please don't impede
<p>		
<p>		Wait... stop... stay away...
<p>		Helix help me to protect this babe!!
<p>		
<p>		Admiral!
<p>		He has been lost, taken from my own hands
<p>		I don't understand
<p>		This can't be fate, Helix must be damned
<p>		
<p>		Bleed out for the sins of those who reign over tainted waters
<p>		They feed from the tears of those who are naught to them -- we're fodder
<p>		Let's hail from the mountain tops, let us bring down those who claim
<p>		We are only afterthoughts, we're not worthy of acclaim
<p>		
<p>		Admiral, please come with me
<p>		We must burn the gods' decree
<p>		Your heart beats next to mine
<p>		We can strike down the divine
<p>		
<p>		Admiral!
<p>		I see them there, waiting with heated fever
<p>		We'll takeover
<p>		We shall become Johto's new relievers
<p>		
<p>		Tiny prince has left my embrace...
<p>		It can't be fate he lost his way
<p>		I understand
<p>		The Helix is damned
<p>		
<p>		Admiral!
<p>		It's over now, we have slain the mighty one
<p>		No more sorrow
<p>		This world is safe, can't you see what we've done?
<p>		My tiny prince!
<p>		No longer will agony plague the dawn
<p>		We have won
<p>		Here we are, no gods, no kings, only 'mon
