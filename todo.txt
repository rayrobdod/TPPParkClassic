FIND A PLACE TO PUT IT!!!

------

Are you going to add in Qwillix? (If you didn't know, If we had picked Helix it would have become a Qwilfish)

------

Oddish House opens to reveal a crap load of oddish!

[Stadium]
Nah, it's fine. Does he ONLY harden in Stadium. Because... harden's not really a thing that I can simulate (there's no stats in the tiny stadium ^_^;). The most I can make him do is... well... splash like Magikarp, except perhaps without the animation.

But Magikarp vs Metapod will lock the game unless you add Struggle.

Well, Magikarp has Tackle still, but Metapod vs Metapod will lock it certainly... :P

[Stadium]
Bug: Names of pokemon on the screen in/on the stadium tend to appear as the name of the pokemon from the previous match who didn't faint, and beat the last pokemon on the opposing side. 
EDIT: May actually/also be caused by clicking off the tab then going back to it a while later, when different pokemon are battling.

[Stadium] Super HP bar bug!

OCCASIONS!! (See js file!)

-------
[ Occasion ]
The 100 Club Dance Party

An occasion "100club" where the 100 club has a dance party on the stage. All the level 100 pokemon are joined in, and the level 99 Aipom Sceptile is there as an "honorary member". The Level 97 Solerion is looking on in shock and sadness, and Shinx is comforting him.

The normal dezions of the stage and house are elsewhere, possibly getting autographs from Gastly, or Oxxy hanging out in the Oddish House.


-------

Both Randomizers have:
- Fish in the forests!
- Cavemen Wooper! (Have a bunch of them dancing around a campfire on the island, Swaqsire leading them, Bugsy looking on, studying them)

Just saying
from Flareonthehero sent 2 hours ago
if you ever add me on tppark just keep in mind that I want to be surrounded by burrito, solaireon ( feel free to add an angry sunshine if you wish so) and that male glaceon we got in the tpp randomizer.

[ Message from /u/Deadinsky66 ]

Compiled a list of some notable lore pieces from end of Platinum-onwards. It ended up being 30 pieces, so you might want to cut some out, maybe not, maybe only take bits from some of the longer ones, it's your call. Some of these are directly game-related, a few aren't, and I also submitted two of my "confessions of love" fanfic pieces that maybe you could keep in. ;)

Besides those two pieces, top 3 I definitely recommend keeping in there are:

1. At least one of the "Secrets of the Black Fur" pieces, if not both.
2. At least one of the "GODS OF TPP" pieces, if not both.
3. Pokémon Black2 Part 5.5: OPERATION LOVE BOMB SPECIAL

Anyways, here's the list, in no particular order:

So that's that. Hope this helps!
